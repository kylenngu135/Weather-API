Core Features:
    - hosts on localhost:8080
    - implement rate limiting

    API Endpoints
        - GET current weather by city name
        - GET weather forecast (3-5 days)
        - GET weather by coordinates (latitude/longitude)
        - Optional: GET weather for multiple cities in one request

    Caching Strategy
        - Cache weather data in Redis with appropriate TTL (time-to-live) - weather data doesn't change constantly, so 10-30 minutes is reasonable
        - Implement cache-first logic: check Redis before hitting the external API
        - Cache key structure (e.g., weather:{city}:{type} or weather:{lat}:{lon})
        - Track cache hit/miss rates for monitoring

    Error Handling
        - Handle invalid city names or coordinates
        - Manage external API rate limits gracefully
        - Handle Redis connection failures (fallback to direct API calls)
        - Return meaningful error messages with proper HTTP status codes
        - Implement retry logic for failed third-party API calls

    Rate Limiting
        - Implement rate limiting on your API endpoints (to simulate real-world scenarios)
        - Track API usage per client/IP

    Data Transformation
        - Parse and normalize data from the third-party API
        - Return only relevant fields to your frontend (temperature, conditions, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
        - Convert units if needed (Celsius/Fahrenheit)

    Monitoring & Logging
        - Log cache hits vs misses
        - Log external API calls and response times
        - Track error rates
        - Optional: Simple health check endpoint

    Configuration
        - Environment variables for API keys, Redis connection, port
        - Configurable cache TTL
        - Configurable rate limits

Essential UI Features
    Search Functionality
        - Input field to search by city name
        - Optional: Search by coordinates or current location (using browser's geolocation API)
        - Search button or search-on-enter functionality
        - Handle loading states while fetching data

    Current Weather Display
        - City name and country
        - Current temperature (with unit toggle for °C/°F)
        - Weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
        - Weather icon/illustration matching the condition
        - Additional details: humidity, wind speed, "feels like" temperature, visibility
        - Timestamp of last update

    Forecast Display
        - 3-5 day forecast cards
        - Each day showing: date, high/low temps, condition icon, precipitation chance

    Error Handling UI
        - Display user-friendly error messages (e.g., "City not found", "API error")
        - Show when the app is offline or can't connect to backend
        - Clear error states with option to retry

    Loading States
        - Skeleton screens or loading spinners while fetching data
        - Indicate when data is being loaded from cache vs fresh API call (optional but educational)

    Responsive Design
        - Mobile-friendly layout
        - Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile

    Nice-to-Have Features
        - Recent searches list (stored in localStorage)
        - Favorite cities (save multiple locations)
        - Background or theme changes based on weather conditions
        - Auto-refresh option
        - Display cache status (shows if data came from cache - good for demonstrating your backend caching)
